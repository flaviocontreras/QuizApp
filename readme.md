#React Quiz

The React Quiz is a personal project to be developed using React. The users will be able to authenticate and then create a list of questions for their account, and then select any of those questions to create a quiz. After creating the quiz, the user should be able to create any number of quiz keys, which can be shared with others. By using those keys, one can answer the quiz questions, and the user that created the quiz can then check for the score, knowing by the key, who answered the quiz.
